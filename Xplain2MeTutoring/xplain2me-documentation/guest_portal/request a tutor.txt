Process
------------------------------------------------------

- The user must provide their Personal Information, Contact Details,
Academic Needs information, complete the human test challenge and then
agree to the Terms of Service agreement.

- Upon submission, the web application must validate the information
entered by the user. If there were any errors that were picked up during
this verification, then the process must be aborted and the user must be
informed of the errors that occurred so that they can fix these errors and
re-submit.

- If no validation errors was picked up during the verification process, then
the information must be persisted to the web application session facility.

- A four-digit random verification code must then be generated and then
sent to the user's email address. The user will then be taken to another
web page to enter this verification code from their email inbox.
Users will have exactly 5 minutes to enter the verification code. If the
period has gone past, the user must restart the process again and fill in 
their information. This is done so to verify if the user entered a correct
email address and proves that the email address belongs to this user.

- If the user did receive the verification code and entered a correct 
verification code - then the web application must persist the information
regarding this tutor request to the data storage facility. 

- A reference number is then generated and persisted. The reference number
is unique to this tutor request application. The format of the reference number
is:

   [TR]-[YYYYMMDD][Sequence Number]
   
   where TR is a standard prefix which stands for Tutor Request,
   YYYY is the current year this request was made,
   MM is the current month this request was made,
   DD is the current day the request was made and
   the Sequence Number is the sequence or ID of this tutor request.

- An email to the application manager must be sent informing them of a new request for a tutor
and a brief of the details including the reference number.

- Another email must be sent to the user, informing the user of that their request
for a tutor was received and that the entity will be in contact soon - along with 
the reference number - of which they can use to communicate with regards their
request.

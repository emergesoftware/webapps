                                    <p>According to a survey carried out by the Xplain2me team, 
                                        primary students quickly lose focus 
                                        and concentration during a tutorial while high school and 
                                        tertiary level leaners take long and also need a bit 
                                        longer to consolidate on all aspects taught. 
                                        Our lessons are therefore 1 hour long for Primary Leaners and 
                                        1 hour 30 minutes for high school and university level students.
